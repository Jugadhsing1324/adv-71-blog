                <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">India is beginning to reopen after a second wave of Covid-19 infections devastated the country in April and May. But now experts warn that a third wave could strike in the next few months.

                    Courts have questioned state governments over their preparedness, some experts have warned that a third wave could hit within 12-16 weeks, and others are worried that new variants, including the much-talked about Delta plus, could weaken existing vaccines.

                    Delta plus is related to the Delta, an existing variant of concern first identified in India last year that was responsible for the deadly second wave.</p>

                <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">NEW DELHI: Be it with the bat or while donning the wicket-keeping gloves, India's young wicket-keeper batsman Rishabh Pant has managed to cement his place in the national team as a playing XI regular.
                    He was criticised in the initial part of his career, especially for his wicket-keeping skills, which needed a lot of work, but he got the support from the team management and managed to turn himself into a match winner. The 23 year old still has a long way to go as far as honing his wicket-keeping skills are concerned, but there has been a definite improvement.
                    Early on in his career, Pant was also criticised for throwing away his wicket by going for rash shots, after getting in. He has worked on that too.
                    It's in fact Pant's exploits with the bat which have made it impossible to keep him out of the team. So much so that he has also become the first choice keeper in the Test team, both in foreign conditions and at home.
                    Former India all-rounder and the 2011 World Cup player of the tournament, Yuvraj Singh feels Pant has proved himself as a match-winner and agrees that Pant has matured with age.</p>
